# unity-boardgame-template
Work-in-progress boilerplate for checkerboard-type / tile-based boardgames in Unity.

Uses a couple of free placeholder assets which I need to get around to properly crediting; and the numeral textures were authoredby Kimberly over at CU GameDev.

# Known issues: 

[1382261](https://fogbugz.unity3d.com/default.asp?1382261_gj5dnp0g3nv5ijmf)
> Player build hangs on blank screen after reporting UnloadTime; memory leak proceeds to eat up all system memory til crash.

This has something to do with the way Unity is deserializing data when the player runtime initializes; logger isn't very useful, so still waiting to hear back from Unity support.
